# Taimako

**Taimako** is a modern SaaS platform designed to empower businesses with AI-driven customer experience tools. It provides an intelligent, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chat widget that can be easily embedded into any website, allowing businesses to automate customer support and engagement using their own knowledge base.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Smart Chat Widget**: A lightweight, highly customizable chat widget that sits on client websites. It uses advanced RAG techniques to answer user queries based on uploaded documents.
*   **Agentic RAG Engine**: Powered by a robust backend agent that acts as an intelligent assistant, capable of understanding context and providing accurate answers.
*   **Business Dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard for business owners to:
    *   Manage their workspace and profile.
    *   Upload and index documents (PDFs, text, etc.) for the knowledge base.
    *   Monitor chat interactions and analytics.
    *   Configure widget appearance and behavior.
*   **Secure Authentication**: Integrated Google OAuth2 for secure and seamless user sign-in.
*   **Multi-Tenancy**: Built from the ground up to support multiple business tenants, keeping data isolated and secure.
