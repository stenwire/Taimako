    # Dropping column in sqlite is tricky, usually requires recreating table.

    # Actually, if previous run failed on FK creation, the column might be there.
    # But we can't easily drop column in pure sqlite without new table.
    # However, if we just drop chat_sessions, the FK constraint from guest_messages might linger if it wasn't named?
    # No, FK is on the guest_messages table.
    # If I don't drop the column `session_id` from `guest_messages`, Alembic might fail saying column exists or similar.

        # Too risky to do manually?
        # Maybe I should just manually modify the migration file to skip adding column if exists?
        # NO, that's hacking.

        # Easier: Rename table to _old, create new table (how to get schema?), copy, drop _old.
        # Actually, let's just use the fact that I can use python to do this cleanly if I had the Model.
        # But I don't want to load app stack.
        
        # Alternative: Just use alembic downgrade?
        # I can try `alembic downgrade e2cd2430b4a5` (the base revision).
        # But downgrading requires the migration to have been marked as done? It failed, so it's not marked?
        # Or maybe it IS marked but failed?
        # No, if it exits with 1, it probably didn't update alembic_version.
